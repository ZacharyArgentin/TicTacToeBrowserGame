# Tic Tac Toe Web Browser Game

This is a simple tic tac toe web browser game I made to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.  
I referenced [UTG academy's](https://utgacademy.com) web dev course to help me make this game. UTG Academy is an afterschool coding camp for elementary and high school children. I currently work there and teach Python.
